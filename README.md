## Assignment 3

Make sure you have installed:

`pip install scipy==1.1.0`

`pip install numpy==1.16.1`

or you will get the following error: 

'Object arrays cannot be loaded when allow_pickle=False'

or something related to the import line:

from scipy.misc import imread

because that function has been deprecated in more recent versions of scipy
